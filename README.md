# sample-3d-ball-project
This is a 3d ball project 
and i am facing 1 problem below -




PROBLEM - I want to save the star permanantely whenever the user starts the game he should able to see his saved star . let me explain in detail - if i collect 1 star in gameplay (which is level 1 actually ) i should able to see that collected star in level menu similarly if i collect 2 star i should able to see 2 star permantly not 1 star ! and so on . Also if I collect 2 star in 1st level (scene - gameplay) and 3 stars in level 2 scene . i should able to see those 2 star in level menu in level 1 button and 3 stars in level 2 button and it should save all that permanently whenever i start my game and move to other scene !
